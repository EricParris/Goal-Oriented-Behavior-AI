I was asked to program an AI within Unity using the C# programming language. The AI was to run from a player controlled character,
go to an object representing a lake when it was thirsty, go graze when it is hungry, and flock as a group when not consumed by a natural
need such as eating, sleeping, or drinking. This was to simulate something like cattle roaming as a herd with the player character being
a wolf or some other sort of predatory animal.
